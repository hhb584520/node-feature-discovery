# Introduction

This software enables node feature discovery for Kubernetes. It detects
hardware features available on each node in a Kubernetes cluster, and advertises
those features using node labels.

NFD consists of two software components:
1. **nfd-master** is responsible for labeling Kubernetes node objects
2. **nfd-worker** is detects features and communicates them to nfd-master.
   One instance of nfd-worker is supposed to be run on each node of the cluster
